Smart Machine Learning Model Recomendation

Objective
The Smart Machine Learning Model Recommendation system is designed to intelligently suggest the most suitable Machine Learning (ML) models based on the problem type and data characteristics. By leveraging a structured taxonomy of ML problems, data types, and model selection strategies, this system ensures optimal model recommendations for various real-world applications

✅ Problem Identification – Detects whether the task is regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, time series forecasting, or control optimization.

✅ Data Type Analysis – Supports different data types, including numerical, categorical, text, image, IoT, and temporal data.

✅ Model Suggestion Engine – Recommends appropriate ML models based on problem type and data characteristics.

✅ Scalability & Adaptability – Can be expanded with additional model selection heuristics and domain-specific knowledge.
